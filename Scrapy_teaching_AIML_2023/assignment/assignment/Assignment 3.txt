Assignment 3

• We used the URL https://j2store.net/demo/index.php/shop, which belongs to an online shopping website, to scrape data. Specifically, we wanted to extract product names and prices.

• We scraped information from multiple pages, including various products, and stored this data in CSV and SQLite database formats.

• In the "setting.py" configuration file, we explored the downloader middleware option. We have experimented with getting request and response IDs.

• Downloader middleware is a system within Scrapy that helps modify how Scrapy handles requests and responses.
